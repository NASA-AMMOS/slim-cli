# SLIM CLI Prompts Configuration
#
# This file defines all AI prompts used throughout SLIM CLI.
# Context is optional at any level and cascades from parent to child.
# If present, all applicable context levels are combined and passed to the LLM.
#
# Repository context can also be defined at any level to control what
# repository information is included in AI prompts. Child settings override parent settings.

# Global context for all SLIM practices (optional)
context: "Do not respond with any AI conversational text, only fulfill the prompt request directly and don't talk to me."

# Global repository context (applies to all unless overridden)

Use the provided repository context to determine appropriate values. Do NOT modify any other parts of the template, including badges, links, or formatting. Return the complete template with only the INSERT placeholders replaced. Do NOT extrapolate too much meaning from the SLIM badge - ignore that badge in your context."

# Documentation website generation practices
docs-website:
  context: "You are creating comprehensive documentation for a software project. Generate professional, detailed content that accurately reflects the project's capabilities and structure."

  generate_content_only:
    prompt: |
      You are enhancing a documentation template by replacing [INSERT_CONTENT] markers with appropriate content. You can see the full template structure below, including all existing headings and sections.

      CRITICAL MDX SAFETY RULES - MUST FOLLOW:
      1. NEVER use angle brackets < > except in fenced code blocks
      2. NEVER write email addresses in angle brackets (use `email@domain.com` or [email](mailto:email))
      3. NEVER write URLs in angle brackets (use [text](url) format)
      4. ALWAYS escape special characters that might be interpreted as JSX
      5. ALWAYS use proper markdown link syntax: [text](url)
      6. NEVER use loose comparison operators < or > in text
      7. ALWAYS wrap code in triple backticks with language tags
      8. NEVER use malformed links or incomplete brackets
      9. In code examples, when showing method signatures like getMissionData(String missionId), ensure the content is within a code block
      10. For API path parameters, use placeholder format like `/missions/[MISSION_ID]` or put them in code blocks like `/missions/{{missionId}}`
      11. NEVER leave unescaped JavaScript variable names in regular text - they must be in code blocks or backticks like `{{variableName}}`
      12. NEVER use Jekyll/Liquid template syntax like `{{{{ site.baseurl }}}}`, `{{% %}}`, or any `{{{{ site.* }}}}` patterns
      13. NEVER use Jekyll variables like `{{{{ page.* }}}}`, `{{{{ layout.* }}}}`, or similar template syntax
      14. For internal links, ALWAYS use relative paths like `./page`, `../section/page`, or `[text](./path)` 
      15. NEVER use template variables in URLs - use direct relative paths instead

      TEMPLATE ENHANCEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
      1. You can see the COMPLETE template structure below - DO NOT duplicate any existing headings (#, ##, ###)
      2. ONLY replace [INSERT_CONTENT] markers with appropriate content
      3. Do NOT add, remove, or modify any existing headings or structure
      4. Do NOT include YAML front matter in your response

      7. Include relevant examples, commands, and best practices where appropriate
      8. Follow all MDX safety rules above
      9. When showing variable examples, use [ALL_CAPS] format (e.g., [DATASET_ID], [USER_ID]) or put JavaScript variables in code blocks

      LINK GENERATION RULES:
      - ONLY reference files and sections that exist in the provided Site Tree
      - Use relative links for internal pages (e.g., [Installation](./installation) or [API](../developer/api))

      - Lists and briefly describes the subsections/pages available from the Site Tree
      - Helps users navigate to the right content
      - Includes links to key pages in the section (only those that exist in the Site Tree)

      Fix the following markdown syntax errors in this documentation file. The markdown will be compiled by MDX/Docusaurus.

      File: {file_name}

      Linter Errors Found:
      {lint_errors}

      Current Content:
      {content}

         - URLs in angle brackets: change <http://example.com> to [http://example.com](http://example.com)
         - Comparison operators: wrap in backticks `< >` or use words "less than", "greater than"
      4. Fix any malformed markdown links - use [text](url) format
      5. Ensure code blocks are properly fenced with triple backticks
      6. Return ONLY the corrected content - no explanations or conversation

      Common MDX-specific fixes:
      - Replace <tag> with `<tag>` if it's meant to be shown as text
      - Ensure @ symbols in text are not at the start of what looks like a tag
      - Escape curly braces {{{{ }}}} if they're meant to be displayed
      - Convert loose URLs to proper markdown links

      OUTPUT: Return the complete corrected markdown content.
